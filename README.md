Thank you for considering my project.

I Used spaCyâ€™s Named Entity Recognition (NER) and NLTK preprocessing to extract and categorize required skills from job descriptions.
The goal was to identify trends in job requirements and analyze the most in-demand skills across industries.
If you have any feedback or comment, please kindly let me know.

Kind regards,
Parisa.
